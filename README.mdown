Flow Scroll
==================

![Screen shot](https://github.com/hugowetterberg/FlowScroll/raw/master/pictures/screen.png "The view in action")

Sample code for creating a simple cover flow-esque scroll view. The view is implemented as a subclass of UIScrollView and is populated with images from an URI. Other add methods (using already loaded images et.c.) and a delegate that recieves selection events should be added.
